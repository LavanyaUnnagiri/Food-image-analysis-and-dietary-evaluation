# Food-image-analysis-and-dietary-evaluation

Food is a necessity for human life and has been addressed in numerous medical conventions. Modern dietary evaluation and nutrition analysis technologies give consumers more possibilities to explore nutrition patterns, comprehend their daily eating patterns, and keep up a balanced diet. In order to investigate and analyse food items from daily meal photos, we develop a deep model-based food recognition and dietary assessment system in this research.  We specifically suggest a three-step technique that uses deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for object classification and candidate region detection to recognise multi-item (food) photos. The system starts by implementing the Region Proposal Network (RPN), which is derived from the Faster R-CNN model, on the input images to generate several region of proposals. It then locates each region of the proposals in the original photos as well as identifies each region of the proposals by mapping them onto feature maps and classifying them into various food categories. 
The system will next evaluate the nutritional components based on the findings of the recognition process and produce a dietary assessment report by computing the caloric, fat, carbohydrate, and protein contents. We undertake comprehensive experiments for the evaluation utilising the two well-known food picture datasets, UEC-FOOD100 and UEC-FOOD256. On the basis of FOOD101 with bounds, we also create a new kind of dataset about food items. The trial results demonstrate that our system is capable of effectively identifying food items and producing a report on dietary evaluation that will provide users with a clear understanding of a healthy diet and direct their daily recipe to enhance body wellbeing and health.
